    <h3>Test Ribeye -- A quick and flawless ribeye.</h3>
    <p>This is just some test text that is taking place as a summary of the ribeye. This is more test text <em>emphasizing the importance of a part of the description.</em></p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (24-ounce) bone-in ribeye steak, 2-inch-thick, at room temperature</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 16 oz jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>Step 1: Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</ol>
    <ol>Step 2: Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.</ol>
    <ol>Step 3: Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Step 4: Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</ol>
    <ol>Step 5: Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing. -- Enjoy!</ol>
